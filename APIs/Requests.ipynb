    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this section, you should have an understanding of\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are working on one of your really cool projects (or even your not so cool projects), you might want to use data from an existing website. In order to use the data, you have to retrieve it first by making HTTP requests. As its name suggests, an HTTP request is when the browser (client) sends a request to the server in which it will return a response back to the browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a `requests` library that allows making HTTP requests simple! \n",
    "\n",
    "## The `requests` Library\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `get` method\n",
    "To start, we will go over the `get` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "`requests.get(<url>)` makes a request to whatever url you specify. For example, we could make a request to the HackBU github. Saving the request in a variable (`my_request` in the example below) allows you to actually use the information from the website requested. "
