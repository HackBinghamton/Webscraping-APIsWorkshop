    "JSON is a common format for storing and exchanging data. JSON files can contain data types such as dictionaries and lists. They can also be composed of dictionaries of lists or lists of dictionaries. Additionally, there is the JSON python library, which contains methods such as load and dump, which can be helpful for both reading from and writing to files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of JSON files\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "Dictionaries are a data structure in which a certain piece of information or \"key\" is matched to values, similar to words and their matching values, similar to words and their defintions in a dictionary. Let's say that you wanted to store information about a specific student. You can use a dictionary to store certain characteristics such as their name and age. \n",

You can use them to store multiple pieces of data that will be helpful in your program later.
