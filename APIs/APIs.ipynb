If you see *No* under the Auth field of one of these APIs, then it's generally free to use by anyone, for anything. However, if an API requires an APIKey or OAuth then it will usually only be free if you are using it for a project that you won't profit from. The HTTPS and CORS fields can generally be ignored.\n"
