        "1. How to use the Requests library with public APIs\n",
        "2. How to parse JSON data returned by APIs\n",
        "3. Differences between NoAuth and Auth APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "### Prerequisites\n",
        "Before starting this section, you should have an understanding of:\n",
        "1. [JSON](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/JSON.ipynb)\n",
        "2. [Requests](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/Webscraping-APIsWorkshop/blob/master/APIs/Requests.ipynb)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. APIs allow users and developers to interact with a company's services through code, making it easier for different platforms and applications to communicate with each other. \n",
        "\n",
        "APIs are also fantastic tools to use for personal projects, as well as Hackathon projects. For example, in our previous Machine Learning workshops, we used APIs to gather the data needed to train and test our models. \n",
        "\n",
        "APIs can range in complexity from simple data retrieval to full control over an application's features. For this portion of the workshop, we're going to do an in-depth example of a simple data retrieval API, then cover the basics of more advanced APIs. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Choosing an API\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we can start using APIs, we have to research and find the API that we need. A great place to start is [this](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) Github repository, which contains links to hundreds of publicly usable APIs sorted by category. *(Fun Fact: The public APIs repo has its own public API! If you ever need to programmatically get a list of free APIs, look no further.)*\n",
        "\n",
        "On that page, you'll notice that each API has 3 different fields attached: Auth, HTTPS, and CORS. The Auth field will tell you whether or not you need to create an authorized account before using the API. If you see *No* under the Auth field of one of these APIs, then it's generally free to use by anyone, for anything. However, if an API requires an APIKey or OAuth then it will usually only be free if you are using it for a project that you won't profit from. The HTTPS field will tell you whether or not the API uses HTTPS, which is more secure than regular HTTP. Finally, the CORS field can generally be ignored as it only indicates whether the API uses a certain browser header.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since everyone likes space (and Elon Musk) we're going to use the SpaceX API to get started. In the public APIs repo, you'll notice that the SpaceX API does not require Authorization, so this is a free to use API. If you'd like to read more about the SpaceX API, you can find its Github repo [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API). Let's dive in!\n",
        "\n",
        "## SpaceX API\n",
        "\n",
        "To get started, we need to import the requests library and specify our API URL. The URL that we use will change depending on what kind of information we want from the API. For now, we're going to use `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches`\n",
        "to get information on all of SpaceX's different rocket launches. Check out the documentation linked above if you want to learn about some of the other things you can do with the SpaceX API, including tracking the Rocketman Tesla Roadster's location in orbit!\n"
